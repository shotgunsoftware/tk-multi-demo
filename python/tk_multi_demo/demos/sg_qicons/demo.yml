display_name: "Qt Icons for ShotGrid Toolkit"

description:
    The SGQIcon class is meant to provide a library of icons for Toolkit Engines, Apps
    and Frameworks to reuse. Methods are provided to create icons, which means that
    you no longer need to include the icon file in your specific application code, nor
    do you need to compile that icon into a resources file. Simply import this sg_qicons
    module from this framework and call the SGQIcon classmethods to get the icons. This
    also helps to s and creates consistency for icons in your Apps. The library of icons
    is currently limited to only a handful, this will be extended in the future.
