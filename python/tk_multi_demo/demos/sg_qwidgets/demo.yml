display_name: "Qt Widgets for Flow Production Tracking Toolkit"

description:
    The sg_qwidgets module is a set of Qt widget wrapper classes that provide some
    convenience to creating the widgets, but main purpose is to create widgets with the
    Flow Production Tracking naming convention 'SG{Qt_WidgetName}', for example,
    SGQToolButton. The benefit to having all your widgets using this Flow Production Tracking
    naming convention is to help manage the style of your widgets. A .qss file can be used to
    apply styles specifically to only the Flow Production Tracking widgets, without affecting
    other Qt widgets. This is particularlyl useful if your Apps are running inside a DCC that
    uses Qt, and you want to ensure the styles you apply to a QToolButton are only applied to
    the Toolkit widgets, and not the widgets created by the DCC.
