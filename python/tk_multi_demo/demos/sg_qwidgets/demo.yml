display_name: "Qt Widgets for ShotGrid Toolkit"

description:
    The sg_qwidgets module is a set of Qt widget wrapper classes that provide some
    convenience to creating the widgets, but main purpose is to create widgets with the
    ShotGrid naming convention 'SG{Qt_WidgetName}', for example, SGQToolButton. The
    benefit to having all your widgets using this ShotGrid naming convention is to help
    manage the style of your widgets. A .qss file can be used to apply styles
    specifically to only the ShotGrid widgets, without affecting other Qt widgets. This
    is particularlyl useful if your Apps are running inside a DCC that uses Qt, and you
    want to ensure the styles you apply to a QToolButton are only applied to the Toolkit
    widgets, and not the widgets created by the DCC.
