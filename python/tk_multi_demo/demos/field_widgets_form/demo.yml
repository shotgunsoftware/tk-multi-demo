display_name: "FPTR Field Widgets Form"

description:
  The shotgun_fields module provides access to Qt widgets that correspond to the
  field types available on Flow Production Tracking entities. The purpose of these
  widgets is to make it easier to build apps that interact with Flow Production Tracking
  in a standardized way. This demo shows an exaple of how to use these widgets directly to
  build a form view for specific fields on an entity. Note that this is just a demo, and
  editing the values in the form will not be pushed back to Flow Production Tracking.
